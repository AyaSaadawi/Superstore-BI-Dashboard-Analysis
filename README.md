# Superstore Dataset Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project delves into analyzing the Superstore dataset to uncover actionable insights that can drive business growth and sustainability. By leveraging Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for visualization, the project provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing and visualizing sales, customer behavior, and profitability metrics. The final output includes a dynamic, interactive BI dashboard highlighting trends and patterns essential for strategic decision-making.

## Key Objectives

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Address inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information in the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Data Warehouse Development
Design and implement a structured schema in MySQL for efficient querying and reporting.

### Data Analysis
Extract insights on sales trends, customer segmentation, and profitability metrics to identify growth opportunities.

### Data Visualization
Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to present findings effectively and support data-driven decision-making.

### Machine Learning Integration
Incorporate predictive analytics using machine learning models to forecast sales and enhance decision-making capabilities.

## Project Features

### ETL Pipeline
A comprehensive process to extract, clean, transform, and load data into MySQL for structured analysis.

### Database Schema Design
A star schema with the following components:

- *Fact Table:* Sales
- *Dimension Tables:*
  - Customers
  - Products
  - Regions
  - Time

### Interactive Dashboard
Power BI visualizations to explore:
- Regional sales performance
- Product category and segment trends
- Profitability metrics
- Customer demographics
- Sales forecasts using machine learning models

### Machine Learning Models
Sales Forecasting: Predict future sales using a Linear Regression model trained on historical sales data.

Model Comparison: Evaluate multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression) to select the best-performing one based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
