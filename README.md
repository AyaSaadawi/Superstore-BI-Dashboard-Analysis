# Blood Cell Detection and Classification Using YOLOv12

## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the detection and classification of blood cells in microscopic images using YOLOv12, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The goal is to streamline the analysis of blood smears, which is crucial for diagnosing blood disorders. By leveraging deep learning, this project aims to offer an efficient, accurate, and real-time solution for detecting red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. This method is particularly valuable in clinical settings, improving diagnostic speed and objectivity.

## Key Objectives

### Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring image quality and consistency by resizing, auto-orienting, and performing minor adjustments.
- **Data Augmentation**: Using techniques like flipping, rotation, and blur to create a more diverse and robust dataset.

### YOLOv12 Architecture
- **Object Detection**: Detecting and classifying RBCs, WBCs, and platelets using YOLOv12, which excels at small object detection.

### Real-Time Processing
- **Streamlit Interface**: Developing a real-time image and video upload feature for efficient clinical use.

## Project Features

### Data Preprocessing
- **Auto-Orientation**: Corrects the alignment of blood cells in images.
- **Resizing**: Standardizes image dimensions to 640x640 pixels.
  
### Data Augmentation Techniques
- Horizontal Flipping, Rotation, Shear, Brightness and Saturation Adjustments, and Blur were applied to improve model generalization.

### YOLOv12 Object Detection
- **YOLOv12 Model**: YOLOv12's advanced architecture makes it suitable for detecting small objects, such as platelets, which are often challenging in blood smear images.

## Results and Evaluation

The YOLOv12 model has been trained and evaluated on a dataset of blood cell images. The evaluation metrics are:

- **Precision**: 0.808
- **Recall**: 0.892
- **mAP@50**: 0.897

The model excels at detecting platelets with high precision and recall. Challenges remain with overlapping or blurry cells, which can affect detection performance.
